# OBJECT

**Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.**

If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
property. Properties tell us about the object, such as
the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.
Each individual hotel might have a different name
and a different number of rooms

If a function is part of an object, it is called a method.
Methods represent tasks that are associated with
the object. For example, you can check how many
rooms are available by subtracting the number of
booked rooms from the total number of rooms


# Document Object Model (DOM)

**specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.**

The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.
It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas:
MAKING A MODEL OF THE
HTM L PAGE
When the browser loads a web page, it
creates a model of the page in memory.
The DOM specifies the way in which the
browser should structure this model using
a DOM tree.
The DOM is called an object model
because the model (the DOM tree) is
made of objects.
Each object represents a different part of
the page loaded in the browser window.

ACCESSING AND CHANGING
THE HTML PAGE
The DOM also defines methods and
properties to access and update each
object in this model, which in turn updates
what the user sees in the browser.
You will hear people call the DOM an
Application Programming Interface (API).
User interfaces let humans interact with
programs; APls let programs (and scripts)
talk to each other. The DOM states what
your script can "ask the browser about the
current page, and how to tell the browser
to update what is being shown to the user.
