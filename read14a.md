**Great article, but I did not understand anything from it other than that companies are looking for all ways to increase their profits
This article was talking about an analysis of the behavior of groups at work and how workers are affected by the behavior of each other, but it does not apply to the current reality because I think that the things they seek or think about do not exist except rarely in this world.
And I had a previous experience, and I did not work in a group to make an application, and I was the equator about programming, but due to the style of some, the group collapsed and we were close to failure in many stages
I was the one who delayed the delivery of part of the program due to malfunctions in the language**

# Transforms

**With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.
The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.**

The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.
Notice how the transform property includes multiple vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. The un-prefixed declaration comes last to overwrite the prefixed versions, should a browser fully support the transform property.

In the interest of brevity, the remainder of this lesson will not include vendor prefixes. They are, however, strongly encouraged for any code in a production environment. Over time we will be able to remove these prefixes, however keeping them in is the safest approach for the time being.

# Transitions & Animations

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
