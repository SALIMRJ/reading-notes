# What are the growth mindset

  It is the attempt to develop the self from all sides, especially self-confidence
By facing problems and not to evade them and trying to solve them by all means :+1:
Whether it is work problems or family problems.
When faced with a problem it is easy to say that I cannot and ~~give up~~
**But you must try to solve it and find new ways to solve it**

I keep myself in a growth mindset :shipit: through:
```
- Learning 
- Accept the advice 
- Meet new people and make friends 
```
