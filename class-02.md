# HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE 

1. RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE 
2. CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY 
3. USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN

**All browsers use JS interpreter to translate your code**

**why use three language HTML,CSS,JS??**

 each language has  a specific goal example:

 ## HTML :Responsible for the structure
 ## CSS  : How will the site be displayed
 ## JS   :This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files. 

 **The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site. Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on several pages (making the site faster to load and easier to maintain)**

 # BASIC JS 

 A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.

Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.

Statements should end with a semicolon. 

**WHAT IS A VARIABLE**
A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary)each time a script runs.

declare variable by Var before name of variable.


 There are many DATA TYPES :
 1. number 
 2. string
 3. boolean
