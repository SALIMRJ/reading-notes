# Introduction
**javascript  allows you to make web pages more interactive 
by accessing and modifying the contente and markup used in a web page while is being viewed in the browser

JavaScript encompasses many of the tradition of rules of programming it can make the webpage feel interactive by responding to what the user does**
**A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed .**
# EXPRESSIONS

**An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.**
***It contains two types of arithmetic and logical operations
Arithmetic operations containing / * + -
And booleans containing> <=!***


# FUNCTION
***Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).***
* It is a script that you write with a specific purpose and it does not work unless you call it
And it can be used many times to do a job, which helps in arranging the codes, quickly understanding them and modifying them easily.*
