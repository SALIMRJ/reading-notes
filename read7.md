# Domain Modeling

 **It is a method used by programmers in writing lines of code to make it easier, faster, maintainable and reusable.**
**It is very close to the way to use the funchine, where you call it when you need it, and it can be used an infinite number of times**

# Tables

**A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.**

The < table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.
< tr>
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening < tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
< td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing < /tr> tag.
< td>
Each cell of a table is
represented using a < td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing < /td> tag.
