# Layout

**Building Blocks**

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

**Containing Elements**

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

**Controlling the Position of Elements**

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

**Screen Sizes**
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.

**Screen Resolution**

When designing for print, you always know the size of the piece of paper that your design will be printed on. However, when it comes to designing for the web, you are faced with the unique challenge that different users will have different sized screens.

**Screen Resolution**
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

**Fixed Width Layouts**
Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.








# JS

**Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce:**

1. FUNCTIONS and METHODS  

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

**VARIABLE SCOPE**

The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope. 


2. OBJECTS BUILT IN
3. BUILT IN OBJECTS
